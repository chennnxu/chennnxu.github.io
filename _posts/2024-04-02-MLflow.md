## Key Terms

**MLflow Tracking** - Logs key metrics, parameters, models, and other artifacts when running ML code to monitor experiments

**MLflow Projects** - Configurable standard format for organizing ML code to ensure consistency and reproducibility

**MLflow Models** - Package ML model files with their dependencies so they can be deployed on diverse platforms

**Entry Points** - Define the scripts that can be executed within the project workflow

**Conda Environment** - Specifies the dependencies and software required to recreate the runtime environment

## Install & Use MLflow

Install MLflow
```python
pip3 install mlflow
```

Interact with MLflow UI
```python
mlflow ui
```

Executes an MLflow project locally or from a Git repo with given parameters
```python
mlflow run
```

## Reflections

- How could MLflow improve collaboration in a machine learning team?
- What components of MLflow seem most useful for managing machine learning experiments?
- How might MLflow help address reproducibility issues in machine learning? 
- What kinds of challenges could arise when scaling up MLflow to large datasets or models?
