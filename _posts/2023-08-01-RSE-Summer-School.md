Glad to have the opportunity to join the [Digital Humanities Research Software Engineering Summer School](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/events/36442/) co-organised by Cambridge Digital Humanities, Edinburgh Centre for Data, Culture & Society, Kingâ€™s Digital Lab and The Alan Turing Institute. 

They open source their learning material on [Github](https://github.com/CambridgeDH/DH-RSE-Summer-School-2023). Thanks for the dedication of the organizers and all the speakers.

Here are some talks I want to highlight:
