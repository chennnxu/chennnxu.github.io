<font color=gray>This is the final work of my Master project in RWTH Aachen University.</font>  

Music is the preferred leisure activity for most individuals. While with over millions of songs, tiny fraction of them are spread widely and can make the Spotify global top ranking lists. This project aims to investigating the properties of hit songs and artists and streaming pattern of hit songs on Spotify. A two-process data collection is done to get the data, following that are the hit songs, hit artists and dynamics of stream analysis. The results show that majority of hit songs appear only once on the list, while a few do spend an extremely long time on the ranking list. Looking at patterns characterizing artists, the results show that some artists are significantly more productive than others while vast of the artists only have one hit song. Finally, there are some patterns on the dynamics of streams identified. The hits analysis on Soptify are not only interesting but also crucial for our understanding for hits properties, and also knowing the power of idea "data has a better idea".
