## 0. Key Terms

**Model Hub** - Repository of thousands of reusable trained ML models
**Spaces** - Hosted apps to demonstrate ML projects  
**Codespaces** - Browser-based dev environment with GPU access
**CLI** - Command line tool for tasks like authentication and caching  
**Inference API** - Hosted API to get predictions from latest models  

## 1. Reflections

1. What benefits does the HuggingFace Hub provide over sharing models on GitHub or personal websites?  
2. What ethical concerns might arise from the open sharing of machine learning models? How might HuggingFace aim to address them?  
3. What are some key differences between the services and content provided by HuggingFace versus other AI providers?  
4. How feasible would it be for an individual researcher or small team to share their work on HuggingFace? What might be difficult?  
5. Could the HuggingFace Hub reduce duplication of effort in the machine learning research community? In what ways?
