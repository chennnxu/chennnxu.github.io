## Overview

### Scenario

<!-- I have been hired as a data engineer by a research organization. You've been tasked by your team to create an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis by the analytics team. As part of a larger prediction modelling project, the team wants to use the report to monitor and measure the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts by source and station.

The team leader has asked me to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

Your job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report. Particulars of the code to be made have been shared below.

As a proof-of-concept (POC), you are only required to do this for a single station and one source to begin with. For each day at noon (local time), you will gather both the actual temperature and the temperature forecasted for noon on the following day for Casablanca, Morocco.

At a later stage, the team anticipates extending the report to include lists of locations, different forecasting sources, different update frequencies, and other weather metrics such as wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility. -->
