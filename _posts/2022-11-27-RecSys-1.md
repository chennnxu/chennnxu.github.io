#### What do we expect the recommendation system do?

RecSys can be seen as use the known links to predict the unknown links.

There are two kinds of prediction a RecSys is going to do -- rate prediction and behavior prediction. Someone say 80% of RecSys pprediction is behavior prediction and 20% is rate prediction.

I am more interested in the the behavior prediction. To do the behavior prediction, we can predict the probability of the behavior, aka, CTR(Click Through Rate).

#### The common problems in RecSys 

There are three main problems that can cold start problem, explore and exploit problem and safety problem.
