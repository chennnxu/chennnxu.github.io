#### What the recommendation system is going to solve?

RecSys can be seen as use the known links to predict the unknown links.

There are two kinds of prediction a RecSys is going to do -- rate prediction and behavior prediction.

I am more interested in the the behavior prediction. To do the behavior prediction, we can predict the probability of the behavior, aka, CTR(Click Through Rate).
