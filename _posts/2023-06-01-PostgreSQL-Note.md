For one project I am working on now about Software Heritage Graph Dataset, the data I need is huge up to 30+GB. To make the analysis more smoothly, I start learning PostgreSQL to help store, manipulate and retrieve data. This blog would be a summary for what I learn, basically the commands.

### To be continued..

```
connect datanase: psql \c DBNAME
quit database: \q
get help: help or \?(press q) or psql --help
list of databases: \l
create database: CREATE DATABASE NAME;
delete database: DROP DATABASE NAME;
create table: 
```

*Prefer use UPPERCASE syntax for SQL commands*
