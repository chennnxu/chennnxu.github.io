<!-- 这次活动是Microsoft AI Tour，那么主题肯定是宣传Microsoft自家的AI产品。根据自己以往参加活动的经验，大部分session talks太过于高屋建瓴了且时长有限，对于自己来说门槛较高，也就是说很多时候听的似懂非懂。所以我对workshop更感兴趣，毕竟可以动手写代码或是动手做个项目，总能够学习些东西。 -->

## Overview

### What is Microsoft Copilot Studio?

Microsoft Copilot Studio, which provide the fastest way to build Generative AI Copilot.

<!-- 那么对我来, 目标是了解Copilot Studio并且能够开发自己的Copilot Studio，是件非常酷的事情。 -->

### Build Custom Copilot called "Pandora"

Following I will build my own Copilot - "Pandora", with Generative Answers and Generative Actions.

#### Generative Answers

My understanding of generative answers is that they enable you to use Copilot to talk with your own data.

##### Build the Copilot

* Press Create Copilot and give it a name.
* Give knowledge source, e.g. a website, to the Copilot for genrative answers, so that the copilot can instantly answer the question over the data.
* Test the copilot! Yes, It's surprisingly easy to get started with Copilot, just a few steps and you're good to go.

##### Publish the Copilot

* Press Publish to publish the copilot, so that the copilot can be added to other channels, e.g. Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, twilio, Facebook etc.
* Select the channel, e.g. Microsoft Teams.
* Open Bot and then will be redirected to Microsoft Teams
* Add the Copilot to Teams. Now we can use the Copilot on Teams.

#### Generative Actions
