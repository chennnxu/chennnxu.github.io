### About the Course
I've found my journey into iOS Development Application incredibly enjoyable. The content distribution has been roughly divided into ~30% Swift concepts, ~30% UIKit, ~30% SwiftUI, and ~10% dedicated to seminar presentations. It's been a well-rounded learning experience that has enriched my understanding of iOS development.

I appreciate (1) the sophisticated design of iOS applications and (2) the vibrant Apple Developers Community. The dynamic nature of this community often leads to evolving solutions, where a fix for one problem may become obsolete shortly after discovery.
Moreover, (3) iOS development proves to be an accessible field, thanks to Apple's well-crafted introductory books, which can get freely from official website, that facilitate an easy entry into the world of app development. This accessibility enables even teenagers to explore and experiment within this creative domain.
Last but not least, what captivates me most is the transformative process of turning ideas into reality, with the ultimate goal of creating user-friendly experiences. 

### About the Project

For the final project of the course, all groups have been tasked with developing a todo app for iOS utilizing the native frameworks covered in the lectures. We have the flexibility to tailor our app to a specific target audience.

We developed a to-do app for iOS using the native frameworks, including Swift, UIKit, Core Data, etc. Our app features a built-in Pomodoro Technique function, enhancing productivity and time management for users.
My responsibilities for this project encompass:

(1)Build Core Data Schema

(2)Launch the local notification function with the badge, title, and sound

(3)Launch the App Setting related functions, including accent color, dark mode, and dynamic font size.
