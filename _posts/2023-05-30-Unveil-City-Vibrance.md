### Introduction

Social events have increasingly become significant indicators of cultural and social dynamics within cities. Social events serve as platforms for community engagement, cultural expression, and tourism promotion. Understanding the dynamics and characteristics of social events in different cities can provide valuable insights into their cultural landscapes and social fabric.

Eventbrite platform serves as a comprehensive source of event data, capturing a wide range of events across various cities. This research aims to create a city portrait by analyzing social event data obtained from the Eventbrite platform. 

The proposed research will address the following research questions:

Research Question 1: What are the event time modes of each city, and what are the differences between them in terms of their temporal dynamics?
Research Question 2: What are the event category segments within each city, and how do they differ from one another?
Research Question 3: How can event sentiment be segmented within each city, and what are the variations between different cities?
Research Question 4: How can event networks be modeled and analyzed for each city, and what insights can be derived from them?




### Limitation
The analysis cannot provide a definitive conclusion due to the limited availability of data, but the value lies in the underlying idea. If an ideal dataset becomes available in the near future, a reassessment will be conducted.
