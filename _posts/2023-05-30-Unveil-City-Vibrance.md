### Introduction

Social events have increasingly become significant indicators of cultural and social dynamics within cities. Social events serve as platforms for community engagement, cultural expression, and tourism promotion. Understanding the dynamics and characteristics of social events can provide valuable insights into city cultural landscapes and social fabric.

Eventbrite platform serves as a comprehensive source of event data, capturing a wide range of events across various cities. This research aims to create a city portrait of Berlin by analyzing social event data obtained from the Eventbrite platform. This research will address the following research questions:

Research Question 1: What are the event time modes?

Research Question 2: What are the event category segments?

Research Question 3: How can event sentiment be segmented within each city?

Research Question 4: How can event networks be modeled and analyzed, and what insights can be derived from them?




### Limitation
The analysis cannot provide a definitive conclusion due to the limited availability of data, but the value lies in the underlying idea. If an ideal dataset becomes available in the near future, a reassessment will be conducted.
