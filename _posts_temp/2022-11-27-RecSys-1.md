### Part 1 More general information about RecSys

#### (1) What do the recommendation system do?(Model perspective)

RecSys can be seen as use the known links to predict the unknown links.

There are two kinds of prediction a RecSys is going to do -- rate prediction and behavior prediction. Someone says 80% of RecSys pprediction is behavior prediction and 20% is rate prediction.

To do the behavior prediction, we can predict the probability of the behavior, aka, CTR(Click Through Rate).

#### (2) The common problems in RecSys  

There are three main problems that can cold start problem, explore and exploit (EE/Double E) problem and safety problem.
Cold start problem: RecSys is data hungury application.

### Part 2 The mindsets you should know

The components of RecSys and their importance: 

UI/UE > Data > Domain knowledge > Algorithm (4>3>2>1)

Data: the food of the recommendation systems. "巧妇难为无米之炊"。

Target mindset(Quantify everything <- Data)

Uncertainty mindset(Probability)

### Part 3 User portrait/ User profile / UP (再看一遍理解)

- What is user profile? 

The user profile is used for and to machine but not for human.
User/Item **embedding** is what we called "user profile", so we cannot say user profile is the target of the RecSys, it should be the by product of the process of building a RecSys.

- What is the key points of user profile?

The two key points to build a recommendation system are dimension and quantify.

- The three ways to build the user profile

Demographical data, history data and black box.

UP from the text data (NLP) include two main steps: change text data to structral data, e.g. word embedding and then is the tag selection from the user. 不知道可不可以这么理解，基于文本的，其实是推荐算法中基于内容的推荐的一种实现形式或事算法，其目的就是为了找到标签，但是基于内容的推荐算法的又不止标签这么一种形式。

什么是基于内容的推荐系统，为什么说基于内容的推荐系统是推荐系统的孩童时代？
